# Range is a function which gives sequence/list of numbers where last no. is not included


num = range(5)    # 0 1 2 3 4 
print(num)

# here, last vala number include nhi hoega


# RANGE IN LOOP

# While loop    Now, While means jabak i.e. jbtk given condition true hai tbtk given kaam kro


i = 1               # ek variable me 1 store kro
while i <= 5 :      # jabtk i 5 se chota ya equal hoega tbtk 
    print(i)        # i ki value print kro
    i = i + 1     

# Here, agr i+=1 na likha hota to print(i) run krti and i ki value hmesa 1 hai to 1 print hota and ek time pe computer ki memory full ho jati to program crash ho jata
